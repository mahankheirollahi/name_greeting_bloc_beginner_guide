# Name Greeting Flutter Bloc Beginner Guide

##### This project is a simple name greeting app designed to demonstrate the usage of Flutter Bloc state management for beginners.Users enter their name and select their favorite color on the first screen. On the second screen, they are greeted with their name, and the UI color changes to their chosen favorite color. This showcases the usage of Bloc injection into the widget tree, the functioning of events, and how to access and rebuild the UI based on the Bloc state.
